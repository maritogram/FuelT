# FuelT - AI Fitness Trainer Android Application
Android application that allows user to manually create workout routines or use the power of generative AI to assist in the process. Users can also complete their created workouts and track their progess. 

This was a project I made for my capstone, I wanted to try out native android development as well as incorporate AI somewhere. It's not fully complete and some features I haven't been able to add.
